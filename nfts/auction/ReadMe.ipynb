    "# English Auction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Executive Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "This English Auction with five bidders and three rounds of bidding demonstrates the use of merkleization for Marlowe contracts. Because bidders may bid in any order and may bid more than once, unless they are disqualified by an illegal bid or timeout, the contract involves a combinatorial explosion of possibilities. Without merkleization, the contract JSON file is 990MB in size and contains 940k `Case` statements, but after merkleization the JSON file is 9.8MB and it contains just 1150 merkleized `Case` statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Characteristic of this contract*\n",
    "\n",
    "*   A seller auctions one unit of an asset.\n",
    "*   Any number of bidders bid on the contract.\n",
    "*   Bids may occur in any order.\n",
    "*   There are a fixed number of bids (rounds of bidding) allowed.\n",
    "*   A bid is rejected if it isn't higher than all previous bids.\n",
    "*   A bid is rejected if it isn't immediately followed by a deposit of the Lovelace that was bid.\n",
    "*   Funds are returned to unsuccessful bidders.\n",
    "*   There is deadline for depositing the asset.\n",
    "*   Each bidding round has a deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Other Highlights*\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Use of merkleization.\n",
    "*   Use of `Notify` to break execution into transactions that do not exceed the Plutus execution budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Sequences of bids in this example*\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Christopher Marlowe creates the contract.\n",
    "2.  Christopher Marlowe deposits the `BearGarden` token.\n",
    "3.  Mary Herbert bids 5 ada.\n",
    "4.  Mary Herbert deposits the ada to cover their bid.\n",
    "5.  Elizabeth Cary bids 15 ada.\n",

    "15. The contract is notified to pay the `BearGarden` token to the role-payout address for the benefit of Mary Herbert and the winning bid ada to Christopher Marlowe's account.\n",
    "16. The contract is notified to pay any funds owed back to Jane Lumley and John webster to the role-payout address for their benefit.\n",
